      <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        Reading Indie Gamers (RIG) is a gaming community. Everyone participating
        in Reading Indie Gamers including, but not limited to our Discord
        Server, social media, and face to face gaming events, is required to
        agree to this Code of Conduct.
      </p>
      <p>
        RIG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone,
        regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
        orientation, disability, mental illness, neurotype, physical appearance,
        body, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, language, or religion. We do
        not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participating in RIG constitutes acknowledgement and acceptance to abide
        by this Code of Conduct in both digital and physical spaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled
        from RIG spaces.
      </p>
      <h3>Principles</h3>
      <p>
        In accordance with our Code of Conduct, everyone who participates in
        Reading Indie Gamers shall function within the following principles:
      </p>
      <h4>Safety</h4>
      <p>
        All games run within our community must use, explain, and support safety
        tools. This isn&apos;t to eliminate challenging content, but to make
        sure that everyone knows the bounds and has given consent.
      </p>
      <h4>Consideration</h4>
      <p>
        That safety doesn&apos;t end at the gaming table, or with formal safety
        tools. We ask when in our spaces you consider your words and their
        impact. It is vital that members can offer opinions and discuss issues,
        but that should be done in a spirit of support, kindness, and
        inclusivity. Think about your intent and act in those spaces with
        integrity and love. Be positive and supportive of others as you would
        hope they would be of you.
      </p>
      <h4>Inclusivity</h4>
      <p>
        Community members must be supportive and inclusive. They should think
        about the impact of their words, the privilege they hold, and the
        relative position of those they interact with. As a community we
        prioritise marginalised people&apos;s safety above privileged
        people&apos;s comfort and will make all reasonable efforts to be
        inclusive.
      </p>
      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <p>
        In the course of exemplifying the Community Principles, all members of
        our community shall function within the following guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Respect player pronouns and character pronouns; routinely reaffirm
          these throughout play and at the start of each session.
        </li>
        <li>
          Practice regular check-ins for enthusiastic consent of game content.
        </li>
        <li>
          Respect player autonomy and practice regular check-ins to affirm
          enthusiastic agreement of game development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clearly declare the concept, aim, tone, &amp; subject matter
          (including clear content warnings) of every game played through
          Reading Indie Gamers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Explain and incorporate some form of tools for safe play (e.g. X-Card,
          Lines & Veils, etc) into every game shared.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tools</h3>
